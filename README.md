# Glas Language

Glas is a purely functional programming (FP) language with several big ideas:

* **Session Types** to model interaction, concurrency, and effects
* **Allocation Types** for embedded systems or hardware synthesis
* **Commutative Monoids** to model extensible systems and animation
* **Graph Rewriting** semantics for partial evaluation, animation
* **Projectional Editing** for extensible syntax and visualization
* **Content-Addressed Modules** for distribution, scaling, caching

These features affect expressiveness of the language and the experience developing and deploying applications. The resulting system will be very different from conventional programming. Glas also has potential to fill useful niches. Read more at [Glas Design](docs/GlasDesign.md).

## Status of Language

Glas is a newly envisioned language as of mid July 2019. It is still in design phase, especially with respect to lower-level details (e.g. how to support generic programming).
